# How to use Learn-OCaml autogen?

Suppose we have a Learn-OCaml exercises directory called `exercises`. We want
to create a new exercise named *circle*. Learn-OCaml autogen only needs an
exercise directory with a file called `input.ml`.

So, letâ€™s create `circle/input.ml`. You can copy the following code to follow
this tutorial. Detailed instructions to write an input file are available
[here](write_ex.md).

```ocaml
open Test_lib
open Report

let%prelude pi = 3.14159265

let diameter (r : float) : float = 2. *. pi *. r
```

The command `learn-ocaml-autogen circle`, ran from `exercises`, will generate
every file needed by Learn-OCaml: `prelude.ml`, `prepare.ml`, `solution.ml`,
`template.ml` and `test.ml`. You can run Learn-OCaml and verify that the
exercise was correctly generated. If you want to change its content, modify
`input.ml` and run `learn-ocaml autogen circle` again.

You can also use Learn-OCaml autogen to generate files for several exercises by
using `learn-ocaml-autogen` with as many arguments as you wish. For example:
```bash
learn-ocaml-autogen circle recursivity sum_types
```

To generate only a specific subset of the usual files, add `--` after the
exercises names. Then add the kind of output files you want. It should be a
subset of `prelude`, `prepare`, `solution`, `template` and `test`, which are
the files needed by Learn-OCaml. For example:
```
learn-ocaml-autogen circle recursivity sum_types -- test template
```
